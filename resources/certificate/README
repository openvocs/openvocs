This folder contains the default openvocs.test certificates, as well as some script to regenerate the certificates.

usage: sudo ./ov_generate_test_certicicate.sh

Development C files using certificates for testing SHOULD use

OV_TEST_CERT
OV_TEST_CERT_KEY

This way the tests will run, as soon as the certificate is regenerated.

NOTE certificate lifetime is limited to 365 days due to some browser restrictions.
