        A VM to process command sequences ('programs') asynchronously.
        This engine is, although asynchron, NOT PARALLEL!

        If you want to use it in a multithreaded context, ensure that
        accesses to this engine are serialized by some means (mutexes e.g.).

        Basically, this is a small virtual machine:

        You define a program, i.e. a sequence of opcodes/args to process:

           opcodes
            |    arguments
            |     |  |  |
        {   V     V  V  V
           {0x15, 0, 0, 0}, <- instruction 1
           {0x12, 3, 1, 1}, <- instruction 2
           ...
        }

        Each line is an 'instruction'.
        The first column in each instruction is the 'opcode'.

        You can trigger the execution of such a program by

        ```
        ov_cntl_instr instructions[] = {
          {0x14, 0, 1, 0},
          {0x1, 2, 2, 2},
          {OP_END, 0, 0, 0}}; <- THIS LINE IS MANADORY AT THE END OF EACH PROG

        char const our_data[] = "Additional data";

        ov_vm_trigger(vm, instructions, &our_data);
        ```

        The program `instructions` will then be processed.
        Note: Each program sequence needs to terminate with an
        `{OP_END, 0, 0, 0}` line.

        Each opcode triggers the execution of an handler.
        A handler is just a method associated with an opcode.
        See `ov_cntl_instr_handler` .

        Apart from `OP_END` and OP_NOP there are no predefined opcodes.

        That is, the user needs to register his own opcodes / handlers.
        See `ov_vm_register` .

        The return value of a handler determines how the vm proceeds:

        `OC_NEXT` :
            Proceed with next instruction.
        `OV_FINISHED`  :
            Sequence done.
        `OC_WAIT_AND_NEXT` :
            Interrupt program and return. Continues with next instruction when
            'ov_vm_continue` is called for the particular program.
        `OC_WAIT_AND_REPEAT` :
            Like `OC_WAIT_AND_NEXT`, but repeat same instruction again.
        `OC_ERROR`:
            Error occured. Instruction sequence is aborted.

        Each program got a timeout. If the sequence has not finished within
        this timeout, it is aborted. (The timeout can be specified when 
        triggering the program).

        Beware: It is guaranteed that a program is not aborted *before* the
        timeout expires. It is not guaranteed how long after the expiration
        the program remains active.

        # Instructions

        Most of the relevant stuff has been said already above.

        The arguments are there to 'individualize' each instruction.
        E.g. if you got an opcode `ADD_DEST`, and your data resembles
        something like {mixer, multiplexer} , you might want to specify
        whom to send an `add_destination` request:

        {ADD_DEST, 0, 0, 0}  -> Send add_destination to mixer
        {ADD_DEST, 1, 0, 0}  -> Send add_destination to multiplexer

        Since your handler receives the args, it can distinguish:

        ```
        ov_cntl_retval add_dest(ov_vm *self,
                              ov_cntl_instr instr,
                              void *data) {

            ...
                our_data *od = as_our_data(data);

                switch(instr.args[0]) {
                    case 0:
                        target = od->mixer;
                        break;
                    case 1:
                        target = od->multiplexer;
                        break;
                    default:
                        nuke_everything();
                };

            ...
        ```

        Why 3?

        During resmgr development, it turned out that 3 is a sweet spot -
        not too many to become messy, not too few to properly use them.

        # Triggering a program

        Sequences are triggered by

        `ov_vm_trigger(ov_vm *, ov_cntl_instr[], void *data,
        uint64_t timeout_msecs)`

        The `data` is just some arbitrary pointer which is handed over to
        each handler in order to allow for passing arbitrary data to the
        handlers.

        When the program is finished, ov_vm calls its `release_data`
        callback on `data` (see ov_vm_config / ov_vm_create ).
        It is up to you what the callback does, but usually it will perform
        some free / release of some sort.

        But how you deal with the data pointer, is up to you.

        However, if your callback releases the data, DO NOT use the data
        pointer ONCE you triggered ov_vm_trigger!

        When triggered, each program is given a unique UUID.
        This UUID is passed to each handler and should be used to associate
        I/O to the request.
        E.g. if a signaling message is created in a handler, the message
        should receive this UUID as its message UUID.

        # Aborting a program

        If an instruction fails or a program has reached its timeout,
        it is aborted.

        Abortion is done by reversing all instructions done this far in reverse
        order.
        A single instruction is reversed by replacing its opcode by the reverse
        opcode, then executing the instruction again.
        The reverse of an opcode has to be given when the opcode is registered.
        (OP_NOP can be employed if the instruction shall not be reverted).

        When done, `notify_program_aborted` is called.

        # Waiting for certain events (e.g. I/O)

        If the program should continue only after some other event,
        the handler that wants the program to wait must return either
            `OC_WAIT_AND_NEXT` or `OC_WAIT_AND_REPEAT` .

        The VM now returns to the caller.

        2 things now might happen:

        - The program runs into timeout -> aborted
        - Somebody calls ov_vm_continue -> request continues

        Example:

        Assume the handler for `S2` will return OV_WAIT_AND_NEXT`.

        A program is triggered:

        ```id = ov_vm_trigger(..., { {S1,0 ,0 ,0},
                                     {S2, 0, 0, 0},
                                     {S3, 0, 0, 0}, ...)```
            -> Instruction `S1` is executed, then `S2`. The handler of `S2`
                returns OC_WAIT_AND_NEXT`
            -> `ov_vm_trigger` returns
        Some other part of the program calls `ov_vm_continue(vm, id, true)`
            -> instruction S3 and all the following are executed.
            -> When `OP_END` is reached, or another handler returns `OC_WAIT*`
               `ov_vm_continue` returns again.
