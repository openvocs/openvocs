        Implement reconnecting network connections.
        Currently supports TCP.

        The principle is rather simple:

        1. Create an reconnect manager using `ov_reconnect_manager_create`

        2. Trigger a connect request to a remote socket via `ov_reconnect_manager_connect`
        3. In regular intervals, try to connect to that remote socket

        4. When the connection could be established, call a use-supplied callback

        4. If loss of the connection has been detected, goto step 3

        5. After usage, free the reconnect manager using `ov_reconnect_manager_free`


        The entire procedure relies on `event_loop` - timers.

        For keeping management data, you must create an
        ov_reconnect_manager` entity before being  able to trigger connect requests.

        For all connect requests handled via one `ov_reconnect_manager`,
        there is only *one* reconnect interval.

        However, if you require different reconnect intervals for different
        connections, you are free to create several `ov_reconnect_managers`.

        BEWARE: Free any reconnect_managers *before* freeing the underlying
        event loop.

        BEWARE: Each `ov_reconnect_manager` consumes one timer of the
        underlying event loop.

        BEWARE: Currently, it is not foreseen to 'revoke' connect request,
        but if need be, it could easily be implemented.
        You can, however, just `free` the `ov_reconnect_manager` to
        stop all connect requests managed by this `ov_reconnect_manager`.

        The reconnect manager has been proven to work with both
        - the default ( `poll(2)` based ) event loop
        - the linux ( `epoll(2)` based) event loop (see `ov_linux` ).
