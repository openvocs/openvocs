# Implementation of the ov_ice_proxy service. 

The ICE Proxy is responsible for connection termination of Webclients and forwarding of audio to internal Multicast adresses. 

The ICE proxy has 2 operational modes:

## multiplexing mode
 In multiplexing mode all incoming connections will be multiplexed over a dedicated port

## dynamic mode
In dynamic mode each connection will be terminated at a dedicated port, which is opened dynamically. Dynamic mode may be used behind NAT environments to allow the server to be running with a NATed IP.

Both modes share the main part of the configuration. To enable multiplexing mode change the multiplexing attribute to true. In this case all configuration withinin the dynamic attribute are rendered invalid. For dynamic mode change the multiplexing flag to false. This enabled the dynamic configuration.
In dynamic mode an external STUN or TURN server may be used to allow the server tp gather itâ€™s external IP ( Scenario NAT environment!) The port range used may be configured also to allow firewall configurations to match.

# How to start ov_ice_proxy

ov_ice_proxy is build like all executables under the build folder. To start ov_ice_proxy you may use 

`markus@RB-BA0007:~/openvocs/code$ ./build/bin/ov_mc_ice_proxy`

# How to configure ov_ice_proxy

The default configuration is located at ov_mc_ice_proxy/config/default_config.json

Within the config several items may be configured:

## Configure ssl

The SSL config contains the certificates and key files for ov_ice_proxy. 
You may change the path to your own certificates.

NOTE a CA file should be provided for completeness. In addition to a CA file a CA path may be used.

## Configure manager

Manager is the ov_mc_vocs application to be used with the ov_ice_proxy instance. 

## Configure external

External is the external host socket configuration. Im multiplexing configurations the port of this socket configuration will be used to provide all ICE services. In dynamic configuration the host will be used with the port range configured in the dynamic section. 

## Configure internal

Internal is the internal core network, where your mixers life. You need to configure the host, ports will be used dynamically. 

## Configure multiplexing 

To use a multiplexing ICE proxy you need to set the multiplexing attribute to true. 

## Configure dynamic

To use a dynamic ICE proxy you need to set the multiplexing attribute to false, or leave out any multiplexing flags. 

In dynamic mode a port range may be configured and defined, as well as a stun and turn server to use while gathering ICE candidates.
