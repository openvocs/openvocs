# Implementation of the ov_mc_interconnect service. 

The interconnect service may be used to interconnect different VOCS instances. 

The interconnect may run as server or client and will try to connect all loops given in the loops configuration. 

# How to start ov_mc_interconnect

ov_mc_interconnect is build like all executables under the build folder. To start ov_mc_interconnect you may use 

`markus@RB-BA0007:~/openvocs/code$ ./build/bin/ov_mc_interconnect`

you may add a config with -c like done in most of the openvocs services. 

# How to configure ov_mc_interconnect

## Configure a server 

The client flag in the sokcet config of interconnect must be set to false.
A password must be choosen for access of the interconnect service. This password is used by a client to connect the loops. 
The signaling socket must be configured for a listener interface. 
Media socket must be configured for the external interface to connect media pathes. 
Internal must be configured to the internal core network of the openvocs instance running. 

## Configure a client

The client flag in the sokcet config of interconnect must be set to true.
The password must match the server provided password for the interconnect. 
Signaling socket must match the signaling socket of the server. 
must be configured for the external interface to connect media pathes. 
Internal must be configured to the internal core network of the openvocs instance running.

## Configure TLS

Domains may be configured within the domains section. One domain must be set for operations. 
For client connections a CA file must be provided to verify the server file during connection setup. 
For server instances the DTLS part must be configured with valid certificate and key pathes. 

## Configure LOOPS

Within the loops section a local loop will be configured e.g. Loop 1 of form:

`"loop1" : {
	"host" : "224.0.0.1",
	"port" : 12345
}`

The host and port must match the internal Loop configuration of the instance running the interconnect.
